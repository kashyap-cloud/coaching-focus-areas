    description:
      "Although you might not feel inclined to take immediate action, jotting down what you need to release can heighten your awareness and naturally ease your grip. Read the story and ideas below, then create a simple list. What are you clinging to? What saps your energy or hinders your progress? What triggers frustration? What obstructs you from reaching your fullest potential?\n\nTwo Buddhist monks return to their monastery after the rains. They reach a swollen river and in front of them is a woman in a delicate silk kimono, distressed because she is unable to cross the river by herself. The older monk scoops her up, carries her safely to the other side and the two monks continue on their way in silence. Later, as the monks reach their destination, the younger monk (who has fumed for the last 5 hours) finally bursts out, \"How could you? We're not allowed to touch a woman!\" The older monk, surprised, replies: \"I put her down 5 hours ago, but you are still carrying her with you.\"",
    importantNote:
      "• As with the younger monk in the story, the things we hold onto (eg. that we feel angry, guilty, hurt about etc.) cloud our mind and stop us from fully enjoying life. The irony is that whatever you're holding onto, it probably bothers you much more than it does anyone else.\n• Letting go usually involves some form of forgiveness or acceptance – whether it's of yourself, someone else, a situation or even an unknown third party.\n• Letting go doesn't mean we condone a situation or behaviour, it's about lightening our load. When we let go of whatever is bothering us we set ourselves free – and get to reclaim that energy for ourselves.\n• While you can't change the past, you can learn from it and change how you feel going forwards. And remember – whatever you find the hardest to let go of is probably what you need to let go of the most.\n• If you need to let go of something you did ask, \"What could I do that will allow me to let this go?\" You may need to make note of what you learned, make some kind of amends, apologise or find a meaningful way to make it up to yourself or someone else.\n• Final thought: You don't need to know how to let go, you just need to be willing.",

A softened start-up allows you to voice your concerns and needs without blaming the other person. This makes it more likely they will be receptive to your complaint because your words and tone are not accusatory, judgmental, or negative.\n\nUsing the examples above, softened alternatives include, "I would like to sit down together and work out how we can budget our money better," "We talked about a deadline for the project and agreed on a schedule, please give this all of your attention," and "I like when we work together to get things done."',
